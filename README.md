# Responsive React JS Website

This project was React JS & CSS Modules [Live Demo]().

Build a React JS mobile responsive website styled with CSS modules - this is a beginner React JS project. We will be using simple React JS features such as the useState hook, reusable components and passing state down from parent to child components. Pretty cool image carousel is used from SwiperJS! Very easy to install and configure Swiper into your react js project so I highly recommend using that if you want to easily add an image carousel to your react website.
